# Business Metrics 

Institutions, management keeps track of the overall health of the business through the result of measurements called metrics. i.e *revenue .

In retail, popular metric is the **average order value** and in subscription-based products, **churn rate** (which we'll learn about in this mission) is crucial.

Metrics are observed across time. Metrics are calculated separately at specific points in time, but are understood in a chronological context.

## Good Metric characteristics :

### Accurate
Metrics should be accurate. if a concept can't be adequately measured, then it shouldn't be a metric.

### Simple and intelligible
Metrics are meant to be read and understood at a glance

### Easy to drill down into
Interested in knowing what factors contributed to the change in the metric.

*i.e profits can be seen has having two components: revenue and costs), we need to be able to drill down into them to understand what the change is attributed to.

### Actionable
Point of measuring the health of the business is not just so we know if things are going well or not. The goal is to act on things if they're not going in the direction we want.


### Dynamic
Metrics need to be dynamic, they need to change over time. This characteristic is somewhat related to the above, but merits some distinction.

### Standardized
The broader the reach of a metric (in terms of its audience), the more the metric's elementary components need to be standardized, so that everyone sees the same thing. Not doing this causes inconsistency and misinformation, potentially resulting in unwanted outcomes.

*i.e lead time is defined as "the amount of time that passes from the start of a process until its conclusion."


### Business oriented
A metric should be relevant for the business.Metrics need to be adjusted to the current needs of the business.

[Measurable Metrics of Success](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_success)

*i.e Net Promoter Score, more commonly known as NPS. NPS is a customer sucess metric that quantifies customer satisfaction.
NPS is then calculated as the percentage of promoters minus the percentage of detractors.

*e.g. **"How likely are you to recommend this product to a friend?"**:

    * Anything from 0 through 6 are called detractors;

    * 7 or 8 are called passives;

    * 9 or 10 are called promoters;
    
* Detractors - Unhappy customers who share their negative experience with the product or company; they may actively spread negative feedback.

* Passives - Customers who may be pleased with the product, but aren't actively promoting it and will quickly turn to the competition if a better opportunity presents itself.

* Promoters - Extremely satisfied customers who will act as brand ambassadors.
